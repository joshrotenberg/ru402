We have provided you with two Jupyter notebooks, one modeling the training set with Hashes and the other using JSON documents. Follow this procedure to create and activate your Python virtual environment:

<pre>
python -m venv vssvenv
source vssvenv/bin/activate
</pre>

Once done, install the required modules defined by the <code>requirements.txt</code> requirements file, available under <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru402/tree/main/src/jupyter">/src/jupyter</a>

<pre>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

Ensure that your Redis Stack instance is running and complete the configuration of the environment by setting the environment variable that configures your Redis instance (default is <code>localhost</code> on port 6379). 

<code>export REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port</code>

Now, you can start the notebooks, execute all the cells, and check the recognition rate presented once all the tests are performed. Execute the following notebook for the example using the Hash data structure:

<pre>
jupyter notebook faces.ipynb
</pre>

And the following one to use the JSON data structure:

<pre>
jupyter notebook faces_json.ipynb
</pre>
