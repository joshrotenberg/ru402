We have provided you with a Jupyter notebook that includes the entire example. Follow this procedure to create and activate your Python virtual environment:

<pre>
python -m venv vssvenv
source vssvenv/bin/activate
</pre>

Once done, install the required modules defined by the <code>requirements.txt</code> requirements file, available under <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru402/tree/main/src/jupyter">/src/jupyter</a>

<pre>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

Ensure that your Redis Stack instance is running and complete the configuration of the environment by setting the environment variable that configures your Redis instance (default is <code>localhost</code> on port 6379). 

<code>export REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port</code>

Now, you can start the notebook, execute all the cells, and check the results.
