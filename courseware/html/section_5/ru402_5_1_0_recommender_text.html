    The idea behind a recommendation engine using Vector Similarity Search (VSS) is to transform the relevant information (title, description, date of creation, authors and more) into the corresponding vector embedding, and store it together with the original data. Then, when visualizing an entry (an article of a digital newspaper or any other media from the web), it is possible to leverage the stored vector embedding for that very entry and feed into a VSS operation to semantically similar content.
