    In section 4, we introduced the most popular client libraries to store and index vectors and perform vector search. We have also explored different embedding models to convert text into vector embeddings.
</p>
<p>
    In this section, we will present popular use cases enabled by semantic search. For example, we will present a simple implementation for a recommender system. Then, we will learn to model pictures representing faces with the right embedding model, and we will implement a basic face recognition system.

    Finally, we will introduce how Vector Databases complement Large Language Models (LLM) to enable generative AI in chatbots. You will learn what Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and basic concepts of prompt tuning to interact with LLMs.

    For simplicity, we will introduce the use cases through examples written in the Python programming language.
