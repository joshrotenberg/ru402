<p>In section 4 we have introduced the most popular client libraries to store and index vectors and perform Vector Similarity Search. We have also explored different embedding models to convert text into vector embeddings.</p>
<p>In this section, we will present popular use cases that take advantage of semantic search. As an example, we will present textual and visual recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, we will introduce how Vector Databases complement Large Language Models (LLM) to enable the use of generative AI in chatbots. You will learn what Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and basic concepts of prompt tuning to interact with LLMs.</p>
