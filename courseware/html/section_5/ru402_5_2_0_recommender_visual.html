    Implementing a visual recommender system using Vector Similarity Search (VSS) follows the same logic of the textual recommender systems. Once the image is modeled as a vector embedding, the implementation is very much alike: the main difference resides in the embedding model used to generate the vector from the image file.

    In this unit we will revisit the same concepts learned so far, but we will work with images, and rather than implementing a recommender system, we will propose a face recognition system.
