<p>
    Implementing a visual recommender system using Vector Similarity Search (VSS) follows the same logic of the textual recommender systems. Once the image is modeled as a vector embedding, the implementation is very much alike: the main difference resides in the embedding model used to generate the vector from the image file.
</p>
<p>
    In this unit we will revisit the same concepts learned so far, but we will work with images, and rather than implementing a recommender system, we will propose a face recognition system.

<h2>Develop your own face recognition system</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    
</p>


<pre>
pip install deepface
</pre>

Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis


<h2>Running the Jupyter example</h2>
<hr>

We have provided you with a Jupyter notebook that includes the entire example. Follow this procedure to create and activate your Python virtual environment:

<pre>
python -m venv vssvenv
source vssvenv/bin/activate
</pre>

Once done, install the required modules defined by the <code>requirements.txt</code> requirements file, available under <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru402/tree/main/src/jupyter">/src/jupyter</a>

<pre>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

Ensure that your Redis Stack instance is running and complete the configuration of the environment, by setting the environment variable that configure your Redis instance (default is <code>localhost</code> on port 6379). 

<code>export REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port</code>

Now you can start the notebook, execute all the cells, and check the recognition rate presented once all the tests are performed.
