In this article, we have explored what happens when a user interacts with an LLM-based chatbot. We have discovered how the system follows a pipeline that includes turning the user's question into an embedding, retrieving relevant content from Redis Enterprise, constructing a prompt for the LLM, and sending the prompt to the model. Additionally, it is possible to cache responses, enabling more efficient and context-aware conversations.
