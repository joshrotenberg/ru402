>>What is possible using the Redis semantic search feature?<<

[x] Find documents that are semantically similar to a given document.
[x] Find books by genre and whose cover is similar to a given cover.
[x] Perform object recognition.
[] Use the same embedding model for images and textual documents.


>>What is the significance of Context Retrieval for RAG when using Redis with LLMs?<<

[] Fine-tuning LLMs for better performance
[x] Enabling real-time updates to the LLM's corpus
[x] Providing accurate and context-aware responses
[] Retrieving recent knowledge for training


>>Why is it essential to manage the LLM conversation history efficiently?<<

[x] To decrease the overall cost of LLM-as-a-service models.
[] To maximize the number of tokens in the question and answer.
[x] To select relevant interactions in the conversation.


>>What happens when a new question is asked in the presence of a semantic cache?<<

[] The LLM always generates a new response.
[] The question is ignored, and no response is generated.
[x] Semantic search is executed to check for a cached response.
[] The cache hit rate is always incremented.
[x] The overall cost of LLM-as-a-service may decrease.
