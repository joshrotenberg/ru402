<p>In this section, we have explored how semantic search can help implement popular use cases at the well-known real-time speed of Redis. However, recommender systems based on pattern recognition (such as face recognition) and smart generative AI chatbots are only a subset of what can be implemented with Redis using the Redis Stack capabilities. </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Fraud detection</b>. Vector search can be used to classify user behaviors when these are properly modeled as vectors, so we can deduce if user interactions resemble previously known fraud attempts</li>
    <li><b>Personalization of product description</b>. Based on semantic matching, the user will read a product description that highlights aspects of the product matching user preferences</li>
    <li><b>User segmentation</b>. Semantic matching enables the creation of categories of users to boost the relevance of recommendations</li>
    <li><b>Contact center analytics</b>. Vector search helps retrieve historical tickets to assist with incoming tickets. When paired with speech-to-text, this is especially useful to store phone conversations as text and have them indexed by Redis.</li>
    <li><b>Customer support</b>. Semantic search can significantly reduce the flow of new tickets if the customer, based on the problem description, gets a relevant document that solves the problem</li>
</ul>

You can think of many more use cases to improve services, processes, and workflows. The ability to provide contextually relevant results takes database search to a new level.
