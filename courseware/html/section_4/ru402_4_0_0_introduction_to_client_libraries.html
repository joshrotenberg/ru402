    In section 3, we have introduced the concepts and features to work with vectors, which turn Redis Stack (and the Enterprise and Cloud flavors) into a de facto Vector Database. We have also made examples using the Python programming language and the <strong>redis-py</strong> client library. While it is possible to use the <code>redis-cli</code> command line client to exploit the vector capabilities of Redis Stack, managing large vector embeddings is impractical, and Python is the standard language for machine learning workflows.
</p>
<p>
    In this section, we will introduce the most popular client libraries to rewrite the simple example introduced in section 3. Then you will have the chance to execute the example using <strong>node-redis</strong> for Node.js, <strong>jedis</strong> for Java, and <strong>StackExchange.Redis</strong> for .NET languages (we'll provide the C# example).
</p>
<p>
    We will also present RedisVL, a Python client library for using Redis as a Vector Database with powerful features such as out-of-the-box semantic caching.
