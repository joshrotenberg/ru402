<p>Hello and welcome to Redis University. This is RU402: Redis as a Vector Database.</p>

<p>We're <a href="https://mortensi.com/" target="_blank" class="page-link">Mirko Ortensi</a> and <a href="http://www.justincastilla.com" target="_blank" class="page-link">Justin Castilla</a>, Technical Enablement Architect and Developer Advocate at Redis,  and we'll be helping you along the way as you progress through this course.</p>
<p>Before we start, we want to give you an overview of the course and show you how to get the most from the time you're investing here. This course is for any developer interested in storing and querying vectors within Redis. We expect that students at this point have a comfortable understanding of Hash and JSON documents and of using Redis as a data store. If you'd like to check out a standalone course on Redis data structures, consider taking <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/" target="_blank" class="page-link">RU101: Introduction to Redis Data Structures</a>. All the core Redis data structures and best practices are covered in detail.</p>
<p>This course includes a theoretical introduction to modeling unstructured data using vector embeddings and performing vector search to find semantic correlation between objects. You will dive into the vector search feature of Redis and understand how to store, index and search the vector space. Hands-on exercises will give you practice in working with Hash and JSON documents in Redis. Each exercise gives you an opportunity to practice a concept we've just covered.</p>
<p>You'll also have the chance to explore language-specific Redis client libraries to make application development straightforward, easy, and fast.  We've included examples for Python, Node.js, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Finally, you will learn what the most popular use cases can be implemented using Redis as a Vector Database, like a recommendation engine, and Retrieval Augmented Generation assisted chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM.</p>
<p>The hands-on activities aren't graded, but we recommend that you spend time doing each of them.  There's no substitute for learning by doing, and we believe that you'll learn best by working directly with the <a href="https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/" target="_blank" class="page-link">RedisInsight</a> User Interface or the Redis CLI.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to complete a final exam. A score of 65% or better will grant you a certificate of completion to add to your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>If you ever need any assistance with the exercises or need clarification with the content, don't hesitate to ask in the <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">RU402 Discord channel</a>. Our Redis Discord server has dedicated channels for each course and various sections where you can get answers to your questions from community members, course instructors, and Redis employees.
