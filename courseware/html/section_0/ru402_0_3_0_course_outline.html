<p>Let's take a look at what we'll be covering in this course...</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<hr>
<p>We'll begin by getting your environment set up and ready for the course.  You'll see how to get your own instance of Redis Stack either in the cloud or using Docker, and how to interact with it using <code>redis-cli</code> and the RedisInsight graphical management tool.</p>
<p>After loading the sample data set and running a test query, you'll be ready to move on.</p>

<h2>Section 1: Introduction to Semantic Search</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this section you will be introduced to semantic search, what it is, what problems it resolves, and what are the popular use cases backed by it.</p>
<p>In addition, you will understand the popular methods to model unstructured data so that it is possible to represent entities such as texts, images, audio files, or other data as vectors.</p>
<p>
The problem of modeling unstructured data is also discussed: the popular approaches are introduced, and you will learn how to work with your data using machine learning models. You will learn to convert text into embedding vectors using free embedding models. 
</p>

<h2>Section 2: Vector Similarity Search</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Section 2 delves into translating the semantic similarity of entities from the real world to the similarity between vectors. The concept of distance between vectors is introduced and you will learn to implement a simple system to find similar texts using the Python programming language. No Python advanced skills are required to understand the example, as the purpose of this section is understanding the mechanism behind vector similarity.
</p>

<h2>Section 3: Redis as a vector database</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Implementing a system based on vector similarity is easy with Redis Stack and all the flavors based on it, Redis Enterprise and Redis Enterprise Cloud. This is the core section of the course where you will learn to configure VSS with different indexing methods, distance types and more. You will understand how to model data using the Hash and JSON data types, and understand the trade-offs to choose the suitable type for your use case. You will also learn the syntax of the Redis commands to create an index with the <code>VECTOR</code> field type and perform VSS.
</p>

<h2>Section 4: Using the client libraries for VSS</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this section, we'll examine how to write code that uses the VSS features Redis Stack.  We'll first touch on coding with the following popular Redis clients:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-py" target="_blank" class="page-link">redis-py</a> for Python.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/node-redis" target="_blank" class="page-link">node-redis</a> for Node.js.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/jedis" target="_blank" class="page-link">jedis</a> for Java.</li>
  <li><a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/" target="_blank" class="page-link">StackExchange.Redis</a> for .NET languages (we'll provide C# examples).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that to be successful in this course, you don't need to be proficient at coding in Python, Node.js, Java or C# but you should check out the code samples for language(s) that you write applications in.  There won't be any programming language specific questions on the final exam, we promise!</p>

<h2>Section 5: Developing use cases with semantic search</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Section 5 explains what are the most popular use cases that can be implemented with Redis Stack and its semantic search capability. From recommendation engines to anti-plagiarism systems, you will study and run examples to understand how to store, index and search your unstructured data and configure the suitable search parameters. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, you will understand the building blocks to developing a smart chatbot. In this section, you will go through the concepts of Generative AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation and understand how to integrate Redis Stack with OpenAI ChatGPT to "chat with your data". An example will follow, so you will be able to execute and fine tune the different components.
</p>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>
<hr>
<p>The last section of the course is your final exam.  This is optional, but we'd encourage you to take it as you can earn yourself a certificate of completion that can be added to your LinkedIn profile as a professional credential.</p>
<p>The final exam is a series of multiple choice questions that test your knowledge of the course materials.  There's no time limit when it comes to taking the exam, and you're welcome to use the course content and other external resources to help you.</p>
<p>If you get stuck or need a hint, just reach out to the Redis University team <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">on Discord</a>, we're here to help.  Good luck and enjoy the course!</p>
