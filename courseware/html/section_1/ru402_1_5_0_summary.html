Different types of unstructured data require specific embedding models to perform the conversion to vector, so you will find models for images, audio files, and text, each specialized for the features that must be extracted. Once the model has been evaluated and employed in a project, it is possible to map a dataset to the vector space and work with it. Once each element in your dataset has a vector associated, you can evaluate the similarity between pairs of vectors and determine the semantic similarity of the related objects they represent using a standard method: vector search, which we'll introduce in the next section.
