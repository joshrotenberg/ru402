    Redis Stack, with its flexible secondary indexing capabilities, supports filters for textual or numerical fields and
    enables different strategies to retrieve the desired data. In fact, with Redis Stack, it is possible to retrieve
    documents using full-text, numeric, and tag filters and include additional geospatial filtering, leveraging the
    supported geometries and spatial relations.

    In particular, Redis Stack full-text search can be extended to include synonyms, consider the base form of a word,
    or even consider the pronunciation using phonetic matching. These powerful tools help you dive into your data and
    extract the relevant content.

    However, searching for the best matches using the traditional filters does not always reflect the user's intention
    because full-text search is based on literal matches of words and their variations but does not dig into the meaning
    of the query for which the user would like to get an answer. To make an example, if we are interested in animals
    chasing other animals, we may search by the term <i>chase</i> and get:

<ul>
    <li>"The cat chased the dog"</li>
    <li>"The dog chased the cat"</li>
</ul>

However, if we would like to filter the results further and get the specific sentence <i>The dog chased the cat</i> or
similar sentences preserving the same meaning (dogs chasing cats), full-text cannot help further, as it cannot dig into
the meaning of the text stored in the database.

<h2>What is Semantic Search?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Semantic search extends traditional database search methods to interpret the user's query and extract the documents
    that match the semantic meaning of the query. With the semantic search features, it is possible to query the
    database in natural language: it understands the semantics behind the query and returns meaningful results. Such
    technology has been on the market for years. However, semantic search is gaining more traction thanks to the
    advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and the availability of on-demand scalable and affordable
    computational resources. In short, semantic search allows querying the database with a question such as "<i>return
        all the documents with dogs chasing cats</i>." In the next section, we will understand how data modeling is
    crucial to performing semantic search and what are the popular methods.
