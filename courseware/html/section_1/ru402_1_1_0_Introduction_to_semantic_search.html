Redis Stack, with the flexible secondary indexing capabilities supports filters for textual or numerical fields and enable different strategies to retrieve the desired data. In fact, with Redis Stack it is possible to retrieve documents using full-text, numeric, and tag filters and also include additional geospatial filtering, leveraging the supported geometries and spatial relations.

In particular, Redis Stack full-text search can be extended to include synonyms, or consider the base form of a word, or even consider the pronunciation using phonetic matching. These are powerful tools that help diving into your data and extract the relevant content.

However, searching for the best matches using the traditional filters does not always reflect the intention of the user, because full-text search is based on literal matches of words and their variations, but does not dig into the meaning of the query for which the user would like to get an answer. To make an example, if we are interested in animals chasing other animals, we may search by the term <i>chase</i> and get:

<ul>
    <li>"The cat chased the dog"</li>
    <li>"The dog chased the cat"</li>
</ul> 

However, if we would like to filter the results further, and get the specific sentence <i>The dog chased the cat</i> or similar sentences preserving the same meaning (dogs chasing cats) full-text cannot help further, as it cannot dig into the meaning of the text stored in the database.

<h2>What is Semantic Search?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Semantic search extends traditional database search methods to interpret the user's query and extract the documents that match the semantic meaning of the query. With the semantic search features, it is possible to query the database in natural language: the database understands the semantics behind the query and return meaningful results. Such technology has been on the market for years, however, thanks to the advances in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, together with the availability of on-demand scalable and affordable computational resources, semantic search is getting more and more traction. In short, semantic search allows querying the database with a question such as "<i>return all the documents with dogs chasing cats</i>". In the next section, we will understand how data modeling is crucial to performing semantic search and what are the popular methods.
