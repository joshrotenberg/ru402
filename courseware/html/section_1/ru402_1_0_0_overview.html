<p>Welcome to the first section of RU402: Redis as a Vector Database. 
    In the next units you will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introducing semantic search</li>
  <li>Modeling unstructured data as vectors</li>
  <li>Generating vector embeddings</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will have a hands-on exercise designed to explore the topics covered and solidify your understanding of unstructured data modeling. Since the goal of this section is to familiarize you with semantic search, the exercises will be based on generating embedding vectors of typical data format such as texts and images.</p>
