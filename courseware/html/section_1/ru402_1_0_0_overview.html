<p>Welcome to the first section of RU402: Redis as a Vector Database. 
    In the next units, you will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Introducing semantic search</li>
    <li>Modeling unstructured data as vectors</li>
<li>Generating vector embeddings</li>
    </ul>
<p>
  This section will have a hands-on exercise to explore the topics covered and solidify your understanding of unstructured data modeling. Since this section aims to familiarize you with semantic search, the exercises will be based on generating embedding vectors of typical data formats such as texts and images.
