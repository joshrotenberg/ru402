<p>
    VSS can be combined with the other querying mechanisms (including VSS range queries), giving us the possibility to run <strong>hybrid queries</strong>. As an example, we can modify the query written in the previous example as follows to indicate that we want to filter by category. Using the <code>TAG</code> field specified for the <code>genre</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>
q = Query("@genre:{pets}=>[KNN 2 @embedding $vec AS score]").return_field("score").return_field("content").dialect(2)
</code></pre>

<p>The result is returned correctly.</p>

<pre><code>
Result{1 total, docs: [Document {'id': 'doc:2', 'payload': None, 'score': '0.305422723293', 'content': 'That is a happy dog'}]}
</code></pre>
