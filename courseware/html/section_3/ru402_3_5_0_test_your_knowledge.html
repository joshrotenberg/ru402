>>What statements are correct about Redis Stack unstructured data modeling?<<

[x] It is possible to model unstructured data using strings
[] Vectors can be indexed when stored as strings, hashes, and JSON data types
[] Redis can generate vector embeddings from unstructured data
[x] Vectors can be indexed using the <code>VECTOR</code> data type
[] Vectors can be stored in a JSON document in binary blob formats


>>Why would you privilege cosine similarity over another distance?<<

(x) When the magnitude of the vectors does not matter
() You are not interested in the angle between the vectors
() When vectors are already normalized
() It represents continuous features more faithfully


>>What best characterizes Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW) indexing?<<

() It uses the the FLAT indexing method.
(x) HNSW sacrifices accuracy for significant performance improvements.
() It compares the test vector to all vectors in a sequential manner.
() It is well-suited for smaller datasets.
