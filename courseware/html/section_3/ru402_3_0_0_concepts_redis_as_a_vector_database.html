<p>In section 2 we have laid the foundational concepts to understanding semantic search: from unstructured data to searching for similar data through the representation of semantic features with vector embeddings.</p>
<p>In this section, we will see how the concepts learned so far can be introduced in a system with Redis. In fact, Redis Stack (and all the flavors: Redis Enterprise and Redis Cloud Enterprise) can store vectors and calculate the distance between pairs of vectors, so you will dive into all the capabilities that turn Redis into a Vector Database.</p>
<p>In addition, we will expose principles of data modeling for semantic search, using the Hash and JSON data types. Are you ready? Let's dive into it!</p>
