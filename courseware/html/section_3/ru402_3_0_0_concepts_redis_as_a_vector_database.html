    In section 2, we have laid the foundational concepts for understanding semantic search: from unstructured data to searching for similar data by representing semantic features with vector embeddings.

    In this section, we will see how the concepts learned so far can be introduced in a system by adopting Redis as the primary database. In fact, Redis Stack (and all the flavors: Redis Enterprise and Redis Cloud Enterprise) can store vectors and calculate the distance between pairs of vectors, so you will dive into all the capabilities that turn Redis into a Vector Database.

    We will also expose principles of data modeling for semantic search using the Hash and JSON data types. Are you ready? Let's dive into it!
