>>What operation must be executed in preparation for performing vector search?<<

( ) Vectorize the documents in a two-dimensional vector space.
(x) Define a distance that will be used to compute the similarity of the vectors.
( ) Sort the vectors based on their length.
( ) Create a full-text search index and perform data indexation.


>>What does cosine similarity primarily focus on in vector search?<<

( ) The magnitude of vectors.
( ) The Euclidean distance between vectors.
(x) The angle between vectors.
( ) The internal product of vectors.
