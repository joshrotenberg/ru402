<p>You have discovered how semantic search can extend databases with capabilities that reshape the search experience, capturing the semantic meaning of the data and enabling natural language interactions with the data layer.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll pave the path to understanding how the semantic similarity of data can be calculated by the Vector Similarity Search method and run examples to test it.</p>
<p>In addition, we will define the concept of distance and see how to calculate it between vectors.</p>
