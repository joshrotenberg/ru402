<p>Vector search is a key function that can be performed between <i>pairs of vectors</i>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is the process of finding data points that are similar to a given query vector in a set of vectors.</li>
    <li>Popular vector search uses include recommendation systems, image and video search, natural language processing, and anomaly detection.</li>
    <li>For example, if you build a recommendation system, you can use vector search to find (and suggest) products that are similar to a product in which a user previously showed interest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vector search in practice</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Calculating the distance between vectors is a trivial operation using some math. Let's consider a simple example using sentences. 
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The following example in the cartesian plane defines three sentences</li>
    <li>First, we calculate the vector embedding corresponding to each of the three sentences and store them</li>
    <li>We define the test sentence "That is a happy person" and calculate the corresponding vector embedding</li>
    <li>Finally, we compute the distance between the embedding of the test sentence and the three stored vector embeddings</li>
</ol>

Here's a graphical representation of the embeddings in a bi-dimensional vector space.

    Let's now introduce the most popular distances that can be used in the comparison between the test sentence and the stored vectors.
