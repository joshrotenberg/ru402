To really comprehend vectors, you need to move our thinking into the mathematical domain of linear algebra, but we'll try to give some examples in two-dimensional vector space that will make the concept easier to understand.

Let's imagine we have a system in which we track people's height and weight:
</p>

<div align="center">
<table>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Height</th>
      <th>Weight</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U1</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">178</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U2</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">165</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">57</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U3</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">183</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U4</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">185</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">85</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U5</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">162</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">53</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">U6</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">169</td>
      <td style="padding: 0 10px;">60</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

If we represent this in a coordinate system, we'll get a graph looking like this:

<div align="center">

</div>

If we add another feature to our users, like body-mass index, for example, we would have to work in a three-dimensional space where our human minds can still easily reason about. Once we start adding even more features, everything becomes more difficult to understand, but the math stays the same. 
We can still represent vectors in this multidimensional space, the only difference is that we won't be able to easily visualize them anymore.

<h2>Vector similarity</h2>
<hr>

<p>From the above diagram, we can intuitively guess that vectors that are similar represent people with a similar physique (weight+height). How do we define "similarity", though? There are many ways to calculate how similar two vectors are, and this is expressed through different <strong>distance metrics</strong>.</p>

<p>One distance metric that's easy to visualize in a two-dimensional space is <strong>cosine similarity</strong>, which relies on the angle between two vectors: the smaller the angle is, the more similar the vectors are, and vice versa: the bigger the angle, the more dissimilar the vectors.</p>

<p>In the image below, we can see that the vectors for U1 and U3 have a small angle between them, which means the two people have a more similar height and weight. U1 and U2, however, have a bigger angle between their vectors, which means their height and weight are not very close.</p>

    <img width="300px" src="../../images/section_2/ru402_2_1_0_cosine_similarity.png" alt="A bi-dimensional vector space">
</div>

<p>Cosine similarity is only one of the multiple distance metrics. In the next units, we will explore what other options exist and are supported by Redis.</p>
